  <h2>ℹ️ How it works</h2>
  <p><b>Earthquake Detection:</b> The map shows real-time earthquakes. Red markers indicate strong quakes, and an alarm sounds if magnitude ≥4.</p>
  <p><b>Tsunami Alerts:</b> Blue markers indicate tsunami alerts in coastal regions. A separate alarm notifies you immediately.</p>
  <p><b>Emergency & Fire Buttons:</b> Press to simulate contacting emergency services.</p>

  <h2>🌍 Earthquake & Tsunami Information</h2>

  <h3>What is an Earthquake?</h3>
  <p>An earthquake is the sudden shaking of the ground caused by movements in the Earth's crust. These movements release energy in the form of seismic waves, which can cause damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructure.</p>

  <h3>What is a Tsunami?</h3>
  <p>A tsunami is a series of large ocean waves caused by underwater earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or landslides. When these waves reach coastal areas, they can flood cities, destroy buildings, and endanger lives.</p>

  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Collapsed buildings and infrastructure.</li>
    <li>Injuries or loss of life.</li>
    <li>Disruption of electricity, water, and communication services.</li>
    <li>Flooding and landslides.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Safe Places & Precautions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>During an earthquake:</b> Drop, Cover, and Hold On under sturdy furniture. Stay away from windows, glass, and heavy objects.</li>
    <li><b>During a tsunami alert:</b> Move immediately to higher ground or inland areas. Avoid rivers, beaches, and coastal areas.</li>
    <li>Always have an emergency kit ready with water, food, flashlight, and a first-aid kit.</li>
  </ul>
